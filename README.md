# Fantasy-Football-Machine-Learning

Fantasy football is a game based on real-time NFL games. Players manage a fantasy football team, and set a lineup of NFL athletes each week to compete against other managers. NFL players score fantasy points corresponding to their real-life performances; for example, in leagues with a PPR (points-per-reception) scoring system, a wide receiver typically scores 1 point for every catch they make, 1 point for every 10 receiving yards, and 6 points for a touchdown. 

This project aims to train machine learning models that can predict a player's fantasy performance based on their performance in prior weeks' games. Ultimately, the goal is to develop a model that performs on par with or better than fantasy football apps, which conduct their own analyses to predict player performance.
